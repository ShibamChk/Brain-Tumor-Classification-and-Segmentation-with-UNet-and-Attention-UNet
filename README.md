# Brain-Tumor-Classification-and-Segmentation-with-UNet-and-Attention-UNet

This project focuses on **classification and segmentation of brain tumors** using deep learning.  

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
The work is divided into two main phases:

### 1. Segmentation and Classification with UNet
- **Segmentation**: Identifying and delineating tumor regions in brain MRI images.
- **Classification**: Categorizing the type of brain tumor.
- **Dataset**: BRISC2025
- **Subtasks**:
  - Perform segmentation and classification separately.
  - Perform segmentation and classification jointly.
  - Compare the results of both approaches.

### 2. Segmentation with Attention UNet
- Upgraded UNet architecture with **attention mechanisms** for improved segmentation.
- **Note**: Only segmentation was performed in this phase.
